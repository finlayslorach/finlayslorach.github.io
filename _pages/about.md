### Myself

I am a recent Biochemistry graduate with industrial experience at GlaxosmithKline where I worked on developing single cell transcriptomics and metabolomics methods. I now work at AstraZeneca as a Research Scientist focused on Genome Engineering. My interests include anything related to cellular and structural biology and protein chemistry. In my spare time I enjoy programming and have applied these skills to deliver projects at work. Finally, I am always looking for new science books based on first prinicples that I hope to gain insight from. 

### My Aims for this website 

I enjoy the struggle of learning new things, but I often find that information resources frequently scrape the surface of a topic or contain information that is useful in theory but not in practice. By documenting my learnings I aim to compile a 'second-brain' to refer back to on-demand. I aim to write detailed blog posts on topics that I have researched to some signifcant degree (from my naive viewpoint) and today I learned(s) (TILs). The latter will often be insights from books I've read. Hopefully these posts will differentiate themselves from the crowded information that is already out there.

I will aim to write accurately but can guarantee I will make mistakes. If you notice a mistake please reach out to me via my linked email.

One of my favourite quotes! 
> â€œNever let yourself be diverted, either by what you wish to believe, or what you think could have beneficent social effects if it were believed; but look  only and solely at what are the facts." ~ Bertrand Russel
