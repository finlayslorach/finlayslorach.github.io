### My Aims for this website 
======
<style> body {text-align: justify} </style>

I enjoy the struggle of learning new things. Often I find that information resources frequently scrape the surface of a topic or contain information that is useful in theory but not in practice. By documenting what I learn I aim to create a 'second-brain' that I can refer back to on-demand. I aim to write detailed blog posts on topics that I have researched to some signifcant degree (from my naive viewopint) and today I learnt (TIL) - which will often be insights from books I've read - I aim to differentiate my posts from the crowded information that is already out there.

I will aim to write accurately but can't guarantee 100% factual correctness. Some posts will be more speculative than others, although I will try to follow the facts and only the facts. So please reach out to me if I have mentioned something incorrectly or too deepen my insight!

One of my favourite quotes! 
> â€œNever let yourself be diverted, either by what you wish to believe, or what you think could have beneficent social effects if it were believed; but look  only and solely at what are the facts." ~ Bertrand Russel
