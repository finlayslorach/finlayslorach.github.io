### Introduction
Biology is messy. Even deciding what are the right questions to ask represents a large unknown biological 'space', complicated by non-linearity and layers of gradation that challenges the deliniation of where certain biological properties emerge. When you are in doubt of the question to ask, high throughput studies are the answer. Single cell transcriptomics have scaled massively since their inception in 2008 (citation 1). One archetypical application of scRNAseq has been in identifying cellular sub-types e.g. T-cell subsets in tumour microenvironments which may be predicative of cancer prognosis' and treatment response. Whether all these scRNAseq publications and consortiums have actually advanced our biological understanding is a separate quesiton, although if one wants to get published in Nature for 'discovering' yet another 'T-cell subset' it is definitely the way to advance ones career.


There are plenty medium articles explaining the 'ideal data analysis workflow' for scRNAseq, so I will refrain (for now) on contributing to an already over-populated resource. In the interim I will think about how to write (hopefully) high quality posts and how I can differentiate myself from others. After all, my posts are mainly for myself as a record (or 'second-brain) for information that I struggled to retrieve from the internet or learned through experience. If these help others, then that is a plus. This first post was written a year ago and has stagnated in my google docs since. The following will include the key principles behind scRNAseq. To ensure generalisability, I assume only the understanding of the properties of DNA and RNA (e.g. complementary base pairing and the 5'-3' directionality of DNA) and transcription.
